          <h3 className="faq-question">How does the peer-review process work?</h3>
          <p className="faq-answer">
          All submissions undergo a rigorous peer-review process conducted by faculty members with specialized expertise in various areas of criminology and criminal justice. These faculty reviewers carefully evaluate each submission for originality, methodological soundness, and relevance. The goal is to maintain high academic standards while also supporting the development of student researchers. After review, authors receive constructive feedback aimed at helping them improve the quality and impact of their work before final acceptance and publication in the CIRT Journal or presentation at the symposium. This process not only ensures scholarly integrity but also creates a valuable learning environment for emerging researchers.
